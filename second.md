# Javascript: The Hard Parts v2

## Outline

1. Javascript Principles
2. Functions and Callbacks
3. Closures
4. Classes and Prototypes (OOP)

## Javascript Principles

**Thread of Execution**<br>

> Javascript runs code line-by-line, each line known as a the thread of execution.

**Execution Context**<br>

> Created to run the code of a function, has 2 parts:<br>
> 1. Thread of execution
> 2. Memory

**Function call-stack**

> Javascript utilizes the call stack to keep track of all the functions that are
> currently running.

## Functions and Callbacks

- Functions promote code reusability (DRY - Do not repeat yourself)

- Functions can be generalized, so that other functionality can be passed to run
custom instructions from another function(callback).

- Javascript functions are first class objects, they can be:
    1. Assigned to variables and properties of other objects
    2. Passed as arguments into functions
    3. Returned as values from functions

- Higher Order Functions either return or takes in a function.

- The function passed to a HOP function is known as the callback function.

- Anonymous and arrow functions improve immediate legibility of the code.
